# torch-onmf
This is pytorch re-implementation of https://github.com/megasthenis/spanonmf, which is NIPS2015 paper Orthogonal NMF through Subspace Exploration.

# To Do
Re-Implement LocalOptW with pure pytorch operation so that it goes much more fast.
Re-Implement and Parallelize the iteration in LowRankNNPCA.
